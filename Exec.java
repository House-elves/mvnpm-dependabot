/**
 * Runs a subprocess and collects what it wrote.
 *
 * This class exists for the ORDER of two operations. A child process writing to
 * a pipe blocks as soon as that pipe is full, and the pipe is small - measured
 * at 8KB on the machine this was written on, not the 64KB the default suggests.
 * So waiting for the child to exit BEFORE reading its output deadlocks the
 * moment the output outgrows the buffer: the child cannot finish writing, the
 * parent will not start reading, and nothing breaks the tie but the timeout.
 *
 * Every call site here used to do exactly that, and the failure was invisible.
 * A pull request whose diff crossed the buffer could never be reviewed: the
 * `git diff` was killed at 300 seconds, the null it returned was
 * indistinguishable from a genuinely empty diff, and the review declined itself
 * as "ungrounded" - every hour, forever. Observed on
 * bin-space-website#8 (2026-08-16), a 10,647-byte diff stalled at 8,196 bytes
 * written, the process parked in anon_pipe_write. Small PRs went through
 * untouched, which is why it read as a repo quirk rather than a bug.
 *
 * Both streams are therefore drained on their own threads, started before the
 * wait, and a timeout is reported rather than swallowed.
